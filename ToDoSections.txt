recording questions
===========================
1. tell me about yourself and what u have done in automation
2. what is your daily routine as a QA tester
    => after allocation of user stories, on requirement basis, i write POM classes
       for which module i want to test. after that i write test scripts. I do
       regression shoot, parallel testing and cross browser testing.
       Mainly i do functional testing.

3. have u created entire framework from scratch
   =>framework already created by team lead.
   
    framework expl-
    - using maven framework with POM archi
    - by default two folders r present src/main(maintain main classes) and src/test(maintain test classes)
    - creates configuration and test data folder to maintain xcel sheet data files, test report folder to maintain test reports 
    -
4. how to run parallel test cases
5.how to include/exclude
6. how to use groups 
7. @listener annotation
8. how u generate reports/test reports
9. use of testng.xml file




===============================================================================
Daily routine
1. Look up for stories
2. Write/exceute test plan
3. how many defects are fixed
4. discuss defects with DEV
5. report new defects
6. write automation test scripts for new features and push new test scripts to repo
7. Test modules, do smoke/sanity/retesting/regression.

==================================================================================

Roles and responsibilities
1. understand FRS doc
2. prepare test cases from test scenario and then writing and executing test scripts in modified build.
3. i was involved in agile model.



=============================================================================


My name is ___ and i work as ___ at ____. Where i am primarily responsible for test automation.
i have xp of __ yrs. I have exp in functional testing, regression testing, smoke testing and end-end testing.



=======================================================================================



1. In manual testing what u have done? API?Performance?Mobile?
2. qualities any software tester should have?
   --> analytical, out of box thinking, should have attitude to break/crash system, knowledge about domain
       good communication skill

3. what is conditional signoff --> we r done with testing now s/w or product can be released in production
                  --> there r 10 modules and u tested only 8 modules, so in report u write functionality is working fine
                      but we were not able to test 2 modules
4. what is hot fix --> once bug is found dev and QA immedialey conduct meeting and release patch, they remove 
                       prev patch and new patch will b used
5. bug likegae  --> while testing we miss bug and during UAT end user found bug
6. alpha vs beta? have u done beta testing - No? does aplha and beta testing environment is same/different?
7. what is release notes ? can we mention conditional signoff in release note
8.scenario - new functionality is added and u r only one tester 
    ->understand requirement, find all possible scenarios -> write down test cases,
      send test cases for review, after approval, 
      start creating tracebility matrix(to verify whether i have written test cases for all requirements or not),
      start execution, defect tracking process, defect education report, retrospect meeting
9. what is test suite --> test suite cotains collection of test cases
10. have you worked on agile module? 
    what is epic? --> when new requirement comes, as a proj manager i will create epic in which basic 
                      requirements will be added, inside that will create multiple stories(divide epic into subdivision called story)
11. for GUI->check look n feel, user friendly, new features should be added
12. advantage of having test case design techniques 
13. given sceanrio and requirements you tell me what are ad-hoc scenarios for that?
    i have zoom link and mail id, i have this to you, now u click on link, we started looking at each other
    then tell me ad-hoc sceanrios 
     - verify link is working
     - verify we connected with right host
     - verify when click on link video and audio are enabled
     - u enetred wrong email id then it will be delievered to wrong person
     - verify time should be same
     - modify url and check still we r connected/not
14. purpose of writing test cases
    - it will increase test covergae area
    - reusable test cases
    - verify s/w satisfy end-user requirement
    - can provide high quality product 
15. what will u do when u found bug and developer mark it as duplicate
    - before sending i will check whether it is already logged
    - then if developer mark it as duplicate and u know that previously it is not looged
       then you can tell what is prev bug and what is current bug is behaving that u have found is different
16. what will u do to avoid duplicate bug -> before reporting bug search whetehr other tester/ previously
                                            similar bug is reported
17. what is prototype model --> it is dummy software which acts like real s/w
    what is disadv of prototype model -> time required to create prototype model, so cz of this
                                         will get delayed to build actual s/w
18. when you should stop testing -> if application do not have any crtical/high bugs,
                                    if according to business requirement appliction is working fine
19. 4 principles of s/w testing--> 




===============================================================================================
                                             
1. basic knowledge required, types of testing
2. should be able to write test cases of anything e.g. pen, lift, laptop
3. should have exp in white, black and grey box testing
4. differences along with e.g. where you used regression testing n all
   a. regression vs retesting
   b. smoke vs sanity
   c. high priority vs low priority
   d. severity vs priority
   e. what is ad-hoc testing and performance testing, monkey testing
   f. functional vs non-functional

5. what is load testing
6. when to start testing and when to stop testing
7. what is boundry value analysis with eg
8. What is RTM, what is x and y axis in RTM
9. how to handle defect, how to report bug, what type of bug tracking tool u r using, defect flow
10. components of bug report --> bug id,description, version, steps to reproduce,visual proof, actual expected,
                                 detected by,status, fixed by,priority, severity
11. defect life cycle, sdlc, stlc
12. for bug tracking which tool is used and for project management which tool u used
    --> suppose JIRA then, how u submit report in JIRA
13. domain knowledge like healthcare, web application, e-commerce, banking
14. basic sql queries, 
    differences 
    a. truncate vs delete
    b. joins concept
    c. DML, DDL related commands

15. scenario - u found bug and dev is not ready to take bug how will u convience dev/BA

================================================================================================
1. stages involved in SDLC and in STLC
2. what is defect
3. types of integration testing
4. what are meetings test engineer can be part of?
